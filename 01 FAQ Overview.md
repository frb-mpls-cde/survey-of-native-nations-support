## What is CICD? 

Based at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/), the [Center for Indian Country Development (CICD)](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/) is a research and policy institute focused on Native economies. We work to advance the economic self-determination and prosperity of Native nations and Indigenous communities through actionable data and research that make substantial contributions to public policy. We serve American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities across Indian Country. 

Our work is guided by a 16-person advisory council that reflects key representatives from Native nations, national organizations, higher education, industry, and federal agencies. Learn more about CICD’s staff, Leadership Council, and resources at [minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/).

## What is the Federal Reserve? 

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It was created by the U.S. Congress to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Learn about the core functions of the Federal Reserve at [federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm). 

The Federal Reserve, like many other central banks, is an independent government agency but also one that is ultimately accountable to the public and the Congress in its mission to promote a stable financial system and healthy economy. The Fed can be described as independent within the government. 

## What is the Survey of Native Nations? 

CICD’s Survey of Native Nations aims to provide tribal governments with the data they need to evaluate their finances in relation to those of local and state governments, and to identify areas of opportunity for revenue growth and diversification. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a similar survey called the Census of Governments, collecting information about state and local government revenues and expenditures. Tribal governments have not been a part of the Census of Governments. The Survey of Native Nations is intended to remedy this data gap. We hope the survey will be a valuable tool for long-term financial planning, for identifying opportunities to maximize tribal revenue streams, and for assisting tribal leaders in telling the stories of their own communities. 

In August 2024, CICD is launching nother round of the Survey of Native Nations with select tribal governments. Ultimately, we hope to offer the survey to tribes across Indian Country as a tool for developing long-term plans for their tribal treasuries and increasing awareness of the unique challenges and contributions of tribal economies.

## How will CICD protect and use my data? 

As part of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has a long history of secure data collection and handling. The Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), which is based at the Minneapolis Fed, will not release to the public any confidential information that is individually identifiable to a specific survey respondent. CICD considers confidential information to include all data submitted by a survey respondent that the respondent keeps private or closely held and that is not available to the public. The data you provide in response to this survey will be used to prepare confidential customized reports for your tribal government showing your government’s finances in comparison to those of other non-tribal governments. Data from the survey may also be aggregated with data from other tribal survey respondents. CICD analysis of non-identifiable, aggregated survey data may be accessible by the public in strict conformity with CICD’s Principles for Research and Data Use. CICD may be required to transfer confidential information if compelled to do so by law or legal process, in which case CICD will provide prompt notice to each affected respondent and will take reasonable steps to ensure that the confidential information is subject to confidential treatment by the recipient.   

## What are CICD’s research and data use principles? 

There are important responsibilities associated with collecting and analyzing data in Indian Country. In conducting research and data collection, CICD and our partners follow [Principles for Research and Data Use](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/about-us/principles-for-research-and-data-use) that were co-created with tribal stakeholders to ensure that we honor tribal data sovereignty and governance. These guiding principles include the following: 

### Informed and prior consent 

Abiding by Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis policies governing data privacy and security, CICD works to inform partners in advance of our intended use of data as well as any potential risks associated with its use. CICD works to obtain—and takes steps designed to ensure that any of our external research partners obtain—informed consent for data collection from individuals. 

### Data protection 

If proprietary, confidential, or sensitive data are shared with CICD, CICD works to take the necessary actions designed to ensure the data are secured and are accessible only to authorized parties associated with the agreed-upon data analysis or research activities. 

### Data governance 

CICD understands that it is the right of tribal nations to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their respective data. CICD uses shared data only for the purposes identified in the applicable research project objectives agreed to with data providers. 

### Prior review of research publication 

CICD and its partners conduct research to deepen the collective understanding of tribal economies. For this reason, CICD research and analysis are typically made available to the public. CICD works to ensure that data providers have opportunities to review the research and analysis, provide feedback on it, and confirm that publications using the data are consistent with the original research agreement. 

### Do no harm 

CICD and its research partners take seriously the responsibility to conduct research without harming tribal governments, tribal organizations, and Indigenous people whose experiences we are seeking to understand. CICD takes available steps to ensure research is conducted rigorously, objectively, and in keeping with the research priorities of tribal partners, ultimately facilitating improved economic outcomes for Indigenous people and communities. 

See our complete [Principles for Research and Data Use](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/about-us/principles-for-research-and-data-use) for more detail. 

## What will I receive as a survey participant? 

CICD will assess the data received through the survey in two ways. First, CICD will assess the data on a tribe-specific level. For each participating tribe, CICD will prepare an analysis of the data collected and provide a report for that tribe’s exclusive use. Assuming the survey response rate is high enough to ensure confidentiality, participants will receive a comparison of their own results with a summary of results aggregated across all participants, and in addition, with results of state and local governments. These individual reports will be confidential and will not be shared with outside parties, including other tribes. 

Second, CICD will assess the data provided by all tribal respondents in aggregate. Analysis of the aggregated data will be incorporated into CICD content and made accessible to tribal policymakers, the public, and other research partners. We expect analysis of the aggregated data will inform public policy with respect to tribal economic self-determination and governance. 

## When will my tribe receive our Survey of Native Nations report? 

CICD values your time and effort in participating in the pilot Survey of Native Nations and looks forward to providing you with the analysis described above. We aim to provide these reports to our tribal participants in fall–winter 2024. 

## How can I prepare for my survey? 

Survey questions ask for detailed revenue and expenditure information from your fiscal year 2022. Having this information accessible will make it easier to complete the survey. 

## What about Okta? 

Okta is a vendor of the Federal Reserve System. It is a platform to verify identity and manage access to secure resources. Okta uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security. MFA combines multiple independent credentials to verify a user’s identity, for example: a password and an email or a password and a text message.  

The Survey of Native Nations uses Okta to protect the survey and information entered into the survey from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Okta simplify verifies your identity. Okta does not have access to any information you enter into the survey. Learn more about Okta in our [Okta How-to Guide](/02%20Okta%20How-to%20Guide.md).

## What about Qualtrics? 

Qualtrics is a vendor of the Federal Reserve System. It is a platform to administer surveys. This Qualtrics environment is managed by the Federal Reserve. Any data that you enter into Qualtrics will be kept confidential and cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. 

The Survey of Native Nations uses Qualtrics to provide a streamlined and user-friendly survey experience. Qualtrics is used by leading research organizations across the United States. Learn more about Qualtrics in our [Qualtrics How-to Guide(/04%20Qualtrics%20How-to%20Guide.md).

## Why does the survey focus on fiscal year 2022 financials? 

The  Survey of Native Nations focuses on your fiscal year 2022 out of recognition that pandemic-era relief funding may have resulted in short-term revenue impacts that would not typically be experienced. 

## Can I add additional survey respondents? 

As a survey respondent identified by CICD, you may choose to identify additional respondents who you would like to help complete the survey. If you would like to identify additional respondents and have not already done so, contact CICD at CICD.data@mpls.frb.org. The final survey needs to be submitted by the person designated as the primary respondent with CICD. 

## Can I save my work and return to the survey later? 

You may exit and re-enter the survey before you submit it. Survey responses are saved when you click “Save and Next” at the bottom of a page. (Note: Work will not be saved if a page is incomplete and you close the survey without clicking “Save and Next.”) 

## What is the survey deadline? 

Completed surveys are due September 26, 2024. 

## How do I submit my survey? 

When you are ready to submit your completed survey, click the “Submit Survey” button located on the bottom right. 

## How will I know if my survey was received? 

After submitting your survey, you will receive a confirmation message confirming receipt. If CICD has any questions about your completed survey, CICD will reach out to the person designated as the primary respondent. 

## How do I view the responses I submitted? 

To see a copy of your responses after you’ve submitted your survey, click on the survey link provided in your survey-activation email. Once you’re back in the survey portal, click on the Survey to see a copy of your submitted responses. 

## How can I get help with Okta and Qualtrics? 

Please refer to the Okta & Qualtrics Guides or contact your assigned CICD Technical Assistance partner (see Who should I contact if I have additional questions?). 

## Will I have a chance to provide feedback on the survey? 

CICD wants to learn from your experience participating in the pilot Survey of Native Nations and will provide an opportunity to share your feedback after the survey closes. Following the close of the survey, we will follow up with each respondent individually to hear feedback on your experience with the survey. 

## What types of revenues and expenditures should I include? 

The survey requests information concerning your tribe’s revenues and expenditures for your fiscal year 2022. By revenues and expenditures, we mean only those funds that were received and expended by and through your tribal government. Funds that were received and expended outside the governing mechanisms of your tribal government should not be counted.
