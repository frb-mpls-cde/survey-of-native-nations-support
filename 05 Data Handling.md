# Data Handling: How is Survey of Native Nations Data Managed? 

## Data Confidentiality and Use

As part of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has a long history of secure data collection and handling. The Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), which is based at the Minneapolis Fed, will not release to the public any confidential information that is individually identifiable to a specific survey respondent. CICD considers confidential information to include all data submitted by a survey respondent that the respondent keeps private or closely held and that is not available to the public. The data you provide in response to this survey will be used to prepare confidential customized reports for your tribal government showing your government’s finances in comparison to those of other non-tribal governments. Data from the survey may also be aggregated with data from other tribal survey respondents. CICD analysis of non-identifiable, aggregated survey data may be accessible by the public in strict conformity with [CICD’s Principles for Research and Data Use](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/about-us/principles-for-research-and-data-use). CICD may be required to transfer confidential information if compelled to do so by law or legal process, in which case CICD will provide prompt notice to each affected respondent and will take reasonable steps to ensure that the confidential information is subject to confidential treatment by the recipient. 

## Data Handling
Survey of Native Nations (SNN) data are handled according to stringent internal Federal Reserve System processes. A general overview of the processes for different types of data is provided below. For further details, please [reach out to CICD](https://github.com/frb-mpls-cde/survey-of-native-nations-support/blob/main/01%20FAQ%20Overview.md#who-should-i-contact-if-i-have-additional-questions).

### Contact Data 

This refers to contact information used for day-to-day SNN operations. These data include a survey respondent's name and business email address, their tribe's name, and information about the completion status of the tribe’s survey. 

Handling: Access to this information is limited to selected staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Unless expressly authorized by the relevant individuals or tribes, CICD does not disclose the identities of participants. 

### Raw Survey Data 

This refers to the data that have been shared by respondents through the SNN survey platform (Qualtrics). 

Handling: The survey environment used to collect these data is exclusive to the Federal Reserve System, and is accessible only to the members of the platform maintenance team. Following collection, SNN data are stored in a secure Federal Reserve System environment accessible to a tightly restricted group of Federal Reserve System staff on a need-to-know basis. 

### Tribal Government Reports/Deliverables

This refers to the confidential reports prepared using the raw survey data. These reports are unique and exclusive to each tribe, and contain selected tribally identifiable information.

Handling: Only the CICD Director and relevant members of the SNN team have full access to tribally identifiable reports and analysis. The data of any given SNN respondent tribe is not included as tribally identifiable data in any other report provided to another SNN respondent tribe. After receiving their report materials, each tribal government (not CICD or the Federal Reserve System) determines whether and how to further share the tribe's report information. 

### Public Aggregate Analysis 

This refers to analyses of aggregated tribal data for research project purposes. Examples include the share of tribes collecting a particular type of tax; the average tribal expenditure on utilities; and other summary numbers. 

Handling: Any information shared publicly is aggregated and anonymized. CICD uses a cautious and conservative approach to ensure that individual tribes cannot be re-identified using released aggregate information. Analysis is typically made available to the general public through web articles (like [this example](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/survey-of-native-nations-elevates-tribal-public-financing)) and similar publications.
