# Okta How-to Guide

## What is Okta? 

Okta is a vendor of the Federal Reserve System. It is a platform to verify identity and manage access to secure resources. Okta uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.  MFA combines multiple independent credentials to verify a user’s identity, for example: a password and an email or a password and a text message.  

## Why does the Survey of Native Nations use Okta? 

The Survey of Native Nations uses Okta to protect the survey and information entered into the survey from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Okta simplify verifies your identity. Okta does not have access to any information you enter into the survey. 

## Get Started 

1. Search your email for noreply@okta.com  
2. Click “Activate Okta Account” in the email.
